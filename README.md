# Handwritten-Prescription-Text-Recognition-System-
This project is a complete pipeline to segment and recognize handwritten text from doctor prescriptions using a combination of OpenCV-based image processing and a deep learning model trained on medical handwriting data. The primary use-case is to assist in digitizing and interpreting prescriptions to reduce errors due to illegible handwriting.
